### Project Ransomware

```
Ransomware attacks have become global prevalence, with the primary objective of making economic gains through unlawful 
means. It can result in the loss of sensitive information, regular business operations disruption, and harm an 
organization's reputation. It encrypts targets' files and displays notifications requesting payment before the data
can be unlocked.


This project includes insights into the infection of the crypto-ransomware that encrypts the files and sub-folders of a 
directory on a Linux machine using 128-bit AES symmetric encryption and demands a ransom from the victim in exchange for
a decryption key. The peoject also explores recent advances in the detection and prevention of ransomware and highlights 
future research challenges and directions
